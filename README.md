## üìñ Introduction

This project uses **technical indicators** like **MACD**, **RSI**, and **Crossover** to predict stock prices. The application evaluates trading strategies through **serial and parallel backtesting**, using **multiprocessing** and **OpenMP** to speed up computation. It also visualizes the results, showing stock prices, indicators, and buy/sell signals.
